The research was conducted on two types of malicious software, mimikatz and cring. As a method for expanding the database of datasets, the boosting method (a procedure for sequentially constructing a composition of machine learning algorithms) was chosen. The process of expanding the database of data sets was carried out in a granular manner, using timestamps. Simulation of the algorithm operation at different iterations and visualization of the results have been carried out.
